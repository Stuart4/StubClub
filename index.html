<p>In today's ticket market, ticket prices start out really high when compared to face value long before an event, and drop continuously until they are below face value once the event has just started. This means that some people are making a loss and can't sell their tickets. Our app solves this problem since users can request tickets to events. A seller can then go and satisfy the request which means that the ticket will be sold to the person who requested it no matter what. This way a consumer can get the ticket at the price they want and the seller can make sure their ticket is sold as best possible market value.</p>

<a id="what-it-does" class="anchor" href="#what-it-does" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it does</h1>

<p>It allows users to request for tickets for sold-out event at a certain price range. As the event comes closer, people with tickets can sell their tickets to these users at the requested price.</p>

<p>On the flip side, people with tickets can also advertise their tickets if want to sell it. People looking to buy tickets can buy these tickets.</p>

<a id="how-we-built-it" class="anchor" href="#how-we-built-it" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How we built it</h1>

<p>The app is built for iOS devices using Xcode, AFNetworking, a PHP backend, a Microsoft Azure server which runs on Apache, and MYSQL. We ran our tests on an iPhone 6. It also has a iWatch interface that helps the user get quick information regarding the tickets they are selling/requesting.</p>

<a id="challenges-we-ran-into" class="anchor" href="#challenges-we-ran-into" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges we ran into</h1>

<p>1) Figuring out the schema of the tables in order to decrease lookup time and store less information 2) Getting the pictures to load faster on the iPhone. 3) Extending the app view on the iWatch interface and sending data between the phone, server, and watch</p>

<p>1) Our interface is user-friendly and attractive. It is one of the main selling points of this app. 2) We used the iWatch for the first time. It was a steep learning curve and we are excited to work on future projects for the iWatch.</p>

<a id="what-we-learned" class="anchor" href="#what-we-learned" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What we learned</h1>

<p>1) One should figure out the schema of the tables and the queries for different functions of the app before going head-on into coding the project.</p>
